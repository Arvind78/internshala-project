Creating an e-commerce application involves multiple aspects such as designing the front-end, implementing dynamic functionalities, and managing the back-end operations. Here's a structured text file explanation for the project:

### Project: E-commerce Application

#### Front-end (User Interface):
1. **HTML:** Create HTML files for different sections/pages like home, product listing, product details, cart, checkout, etc.
2. **CSS/Bootstrap:** Implement responsive design using CSS or Bootstrap for consistent styling and layout across various device sizes.
3. **JavaScript:** Use JavaScript for dynamic functionalities like cart management, search filtering, displaying product details, and interactions.

#### Dynamic Header and Footer:
1. **Header:** Dynamically generate the header using JavaScript to include navigation links, search functionality, user account details, etc.
2. **Footer:** Generate the footer dynamically to include contact information, social media links, site navigation, etc.

#### E-commerce Functionalities:
1. **Product Display:** Show product listings with images, names, prices, and Add to Cart buttons.
2. **Cart Management:** Enable adding/removing products to/from the cart, updating quantities, and calculating the total price.
3. **Search Functionality:** Implement search functionality to filter products based on categories and subcategories.
4. **Product Details:** Show detailed information about each product when clicked or hovered.
5. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is fully responsive from large to small devices for optimal user experience.

#### Back-end Operations:
1. **Server-Side Implementation:** Utilize server-side scripting (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP) to handle backend operations.
2. **Database Integration:** Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to store product details, user information, and cart data.
3. **APIs:** Create APIs to interact between the front-end and back-end for functionalities like fetching product data, managing cart items, etc.

#### Summary and Total Price:
1. **Summary Section:** Display a summary section in the cart displaying all added products with details.
2. **Total Cart Product Price:** Calculate and display the total price of products in the cart.
